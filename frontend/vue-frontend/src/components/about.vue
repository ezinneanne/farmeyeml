        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          FarmEye is a farming productivity-oriented platform born out of a simple but pressing question: 
          How can we solve the countless problems facing Nigerian agriculture in a sustainable way?
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          The idea for FarmEye emerged from observing the struggles of local farmersâ€”low yields due to poor soil management, limited access to real-time data, and the absence of farmer-friendly technologies. Rather than focusing on quick fixes, we envisioned a platform that leverages smart policies, data-driven insights, and technology to transform the way farming is practiced.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          At its core, FarmEye aims to bridge the gap between traditional farming practices and modern agricultural innovation. By providing farmers with actionable insights, improved resource management, and decision-support tools, the platform helps boost productivity while ensuring sustainability. Our mission is not just to support individual farmers but to contribute to reshaping the broader agricultural landscape in Nigeria.
